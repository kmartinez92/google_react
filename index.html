I am going to psuedocode this one as well. Most of my time has been taken up by the project. 

1. I will create a components folder that will hold all of my components. 
2. I will bring in axios, react and express in their respective files. 
3. Once I have those installed with node by using npm init and install i will being create the correct calls. 
4. Within the components i will use hooks to bring in the state that I want and just require them on the same line as the react at the top. 
5. I'll use componendDidMount to show all of the data pulled from the search. I can also use the componenedWillUpdate lifecycle for once an event has happened.
